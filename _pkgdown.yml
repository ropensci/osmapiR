    Every modification of the standard OSM elements has to reference an open changeset. A changeset may contain tags
    just like the other elements. A recommended tag for changesets is the key ''comment=*'' with a short human readable
    description of the changes being made in that changeset. A new changeset can be opened at any time and a changeset
    may be referenced from multiple API calls. Because of this it can be closed manually as the server can't know when
    one changeset ends and another should begin. To avoid stale open changesets a mechanism is implemented to
    automatically close changesets. See [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Changeset) for details.

    In violation of the [GPX standard](https://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/#type_trksegType) when downloading public GPX
    traces through the API, all waypoints of non-trackable traces are randomized (or rather sorted by lat/lon) and
    delivered as one trackSegment for privacy reasons. Trackable traces are delivered, sorted by descending upload time,
    before the waypoints of non-trackable traces.

    The [OsmChange](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmChange) format can be uploaded to the server. This is
    guaranteed to be running in a transaction. So either all the changes are applied or none. To avoid performance
    issues when uploading multiple objects, the use of the `osm_diff_upload_changeset()` is highly recommended.
